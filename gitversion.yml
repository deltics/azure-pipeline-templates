# Runs GitVersion to determine the SemVer for the build based on git commit history.
#  This version is then stashed in pipeline variable 'gitversion' which may then be
#  referenced in subsequent pipeline steps as $(gitversion).

# This version is also used to set the label for the Azure DevOps pipeline run.

# NOTE: 
#    This template expects and requires that GitVersion is installed on the build
#     machine  (https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion)
#
#    Install on Windows using chocolatey: choco install GitVersion.Portable
#
#    The Git command-line client is also required (not by GitVersion itself but due
#     the need to run Git commands to sync tags).

steps:
- powershell: |
    # First make sure that local tags reflect remote tags (otherwise any which were
    #  deleted in the remote will still be in the local repo).  The two commands that
    #  follow first delete ALL local tags then fetch tags from the remote)
    
    git tag -l | %{git tag -d $_}
    git fetch --tags
    
    # Now we can run GitVersion, confident that any tag-based versioning will reflect
    #  the tags in the repo.
